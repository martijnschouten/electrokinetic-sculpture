# Electrokinetic sculpture
This sculpture has been built as a demonstration of electrical friction compensation. The sculpture aims to create the same long-lasting mesmerizing effect as the work of [David C. Roy](https://www.woodthatworks.com/), but with cheap mechanical components, 3D printed parts and smart electronics.
