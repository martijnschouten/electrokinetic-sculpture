# Electrokinetic sculpture
This sculpture has been built as a demonstration of electrical friction compensation. The sculpture aims to create the same long-lasting mesmerizing effect as the work of [David C. Roy](https://www.woodthatworks.com/), but with cheap mechanical components, 3D printed parts and smart electronics. The second mode is a zen mode in this mode the sculpture just rotates slowly.

The sculpture currently has two modes. There is interactive mode in which it is possible to interact with the front wheel. In this cases the front wheel reacts as if it was connected to a passive system with little friction and a large moment of inertia. To see a video of the interactive mode click [here](https://youtu.be/oQwkW7BH-mE). The second mode is a zen mode in this mode the sculpture just rotates slowly, a video of this mode can be found [here](https://youtu.be/FcRmKU-JQ9s "Video on Youtube")
